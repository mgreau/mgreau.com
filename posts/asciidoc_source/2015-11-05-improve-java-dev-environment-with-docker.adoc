== Description:

=== Dockerize your Java Development Environment with Machine & Compose

Developers, *Docker Compose* is the key to be efficient with your development environment!

Whatever the project and the technologies behind it, all developers should be able to work on it quickly *without losing time to setup their development environment*.

Today, we really think that Docker, with Machine & Compose, have changed the way to work on developer side. 

And now, as a developer, you are able to develop quickly with an environment closest to the production environment.

We will show you how you can develop, build, debug and run your Java, Web, multi-databases applications *easily thanks to Docker*.
